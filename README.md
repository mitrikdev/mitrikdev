# 👋 Hi, I’m John Mitrik

**Senior Full-Stack Product Engineer**  
Builder • Systems Thinker • UI/UX-Driven Problem Solver  
Pittsburgh, PA

I design and build full-stack applications that solve real operational problems — 
often in environments where data is messy, requirements are unclear, and reliability truly matters.

I’m best described as a hybrid engineer:
- I love **clean UI/UX** and thoughtful interfaces  
- I thrive in **TypeScript + React**  
- I architect **Node/Express APIs** and **SQL data models**  
- I enjoy turning ambiguous ideas into polished, production-quality features  

I’ve spent the last several years modernizing critical workflows in manufacturing and robotics, owning systems end-to-end and delivering fast, reliable solutions that people depend on every day.
